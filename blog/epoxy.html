                            These days, it's pretty common for a single application to use multiple different data stores.
                            Sometimes, it's because each data store is specialized for a particular task.
                            For example, an e-commerce site might use Postgres for robust customer data management, Elasticsearch for fast product search, and S3 for cheap image storage.
                            Other times, it's because an app was built by multiple teams over time, so it ends up with one service storing customer data in Postgres and another storing customer data in MongoDB.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Building apps with multiple data stores is tricky because it's hard to coordinate operations across those stores.
                            Most databases have a notion of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_transaction">transaction</a>, a group of related operations which execute as a single <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID">atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable</a> unit of work.
                            The canonical example of a transaction is transferring money between bank accounts: to transfer $100 from me to you, the bank runs a transaction which withdraws $100 from my account and deposits $100 in your account.  
                            By running both operations in one transaction, we guarantee that either both go through (and the money is transferred) or neither do (and nothing happens), avoiding failure states where $100 disappears from my account but doesn't appear in yours.
                            However, transactions only work within a single database, so if our two accounts are in different systems, transferring money reliably is much harder.
                            The traditional solution is to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-phase_commit_protocol">two-phase commit</a> through a protocol like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X/Open_XA">X/Open XA</a>, 
                            but while XA is supported by most big relational databases like Postgres and MySQL, it's not supported by popular newer data stores like MongoDB, Cassandra, or Elasticsearch, even though those stores are increasingly embracing transactions.
                            This means that if you want to perform reliable operations across multiple data stores, you probably have to do all the hard work of synchronization, concurrency control, and failure management yourself.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            In this blog post, I want to tell you about a new protocol named Epoxy (<a href="http://petereliaskraft.net/res/p2732-kraft.pdf">paper</a>), developed as part of my PhD work at Stanford, which should make this problem easier by providing ACID transactions across diverse data stores.
                            The basic idea behind Epoxy is that we can use a single transactional "primary database", like Postgres, to coordinate transactions among itself and multiple potentially non-transactional "secondary stores", like MongoDB or Elasticsearch.
                            Here's the high-level architecture:
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                <img src="../images/EpoxyBlogPost/epoxy-architecture.jpg" 
                                         sizes="(max-width: 2100px) 100vw, 2100px" alt="">
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Epoxy works by adapting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiversion_concurrency_control">multi-version concurrency control (MVCC)</a> to a cross-data store setting.
                            We start an Epoxy transaction by initiating a transaction on the primary database.
                            From the primary database, we get two useful pieces of information.
                            The first is a transaction ID, which is guaranteed to be unique and monotonically increasing.
                            The second is a snapshot, a list of all past transactions whose effects are visible to our new transaction.
                            Typically, that's all transaction that committed before our new transaction began.
                            Here's what a snapshot might look like:
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                <img src="../images/EpoxyBlogPost/epoxy-snapshot.jpg" 
                                         sizes="(max-width: 2100px) 100vw, 2100px" alt="">
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Here, the blue transactions form the snapshot of our new transaction T11, while the pink transactions are invisible to it (likely because they are not yet complete).
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            After beginning a transaction, Epoxy interposes on all the transaction's reads and writes to secondary stores to enforce transactional safety.
                            Whenever a record is updated on any secondary store, Epoxy doesn't change it in place, but instead creates a new version of it.
                            It tags that version with two pieces of metadata: the ID of the transaction that created the version and the ID of the transaction that superseded it with a new version (this is initialized to infinity, then set when the version is superseded).
                            Epoxy stores that metadata inside the record itself, for example as an additional field in a MongoDB or Elasticsearch document.
                            Then, whenever a read occurs, Epoxy filters its input data source to only see records whose first field is in the transaction snapshot and whose second field is not (in other words, each transaction can only see the one unique version of a record that was created by a transaction in its snapshot, but not superseded by any transaction in its snapshot).
                            The overall effect of this is to enforce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_(database_systems)">transactional isolation</a>, specifically <a href="https://jepsen.io/consistency/models/snapshot-isolation">snapshot isolation</a>: 
                            across all data stores, each transaction has the abstraction of working on a fixed view of the data containing only the changes committed by transactions in its snapshot.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Epoxy's MVCC also helps it guarantee that transactions are atomic and durable: they either fully commit or fully abort and persist through failures once committed.
                            After a transaction is done with all operations on all stores, Epoxy validates it, verifying that none of its operations conflict with concurrent committed transactions on any data store (this is a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control">optimistic concurrency control</a>).
                            It then asks all secondary stores to persist all new versions to durable storage.
                            If these steps succeed, Epoxy commits the transaction simply by committing on the primary database.
                            This causes the transaction to appear in the snapshots of future transactions, atomically making it visible to all future transactions on all data stores.
                            If anything goes wrong, Epoxy aborts, simply rolling back the transaction on the primary database and deleting new versions on all secondary stores.
                            Even if that process takes a long time, that's fine--none of the transaction's changes are visible to any other transactions because, unless committed, it can't appear in their snapshots.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Of course, like any new protocol, Epoxy has some limitations.
                            The first is performance.
                            As you'd expect, all this interposition comes with some overhead.
                            We analyzed it in <a href="http://petereliaskraft.net/res/p2732-kraft.pdf">our paper</a>--Epoxy performs similarly to XA on the popular database benchmark <a href="https://www.tpc.org/tpcc/default5.asp">TPC-C</a>
                            (while providing stronger guarantees and supporting more databases) and, on simulated microservices, adds overhead of &lt;10% on read-mostly workloads and ~70% on write-heavy workloads compared to a coordination-free baseline.
                            The second is interoperability.
                            Epoxy physically modifies records on secondary stores by adding versioning metadata to them, which means it must be the exclusive mode of accessing a secondary store table.
                            If one application accessing a secondary store table uses Epoxy, all other applications using that store must use Epoxy for operations on that table.
                            This could make Epoxy tricky to adopt for coordinating with a database used by multiple services, and it's something that can hopefully be improved in future research.
